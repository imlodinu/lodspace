# objectives
- [x] I can review what is meant by a fossil fuel (coal, crude oil, natural gas).  [completion:: 2023-07-20]
	- [[#fossil fuels]]
- [ ] I can explain what happens to the levels of CO2 in the atmosphere with the burning of fossil fuels.
- [ ] I can describe the greenhouse effect using ideas about energy and radiation:
    - Earthâ€™s surface absorbs visible light from sun, temp increases, emits infrared radiation.
    - Greenhouse gases (including CO2) absorb infrared and gain vibrational energy which increases kinetic energy therefore temp of atmosphere.
- [ ] I can name common greenhouse gases (CO2, CH4, N2O, CFCs & HFCs)
- [ ] I can describe some effects of the greenhouse effect (local & global).
# fossil fuels
- a fossil fuel is a substance formed through <mark style="background: #ABF7F7A6;">high temperatures</mark> and <mark style="background: #ABF7F7A6;">high pressure</mark> from <mark style="background: #ABF7F7A6;">decaying</mark> plant and animal matter over prolonged periods of time.
- a fossil fuel ultimately is a hydrocarbon mixture.
## burning of fossil fuels
- the levels of $CO_2$ in the atmosphere increases with the burning of fossil fuels.
	- fossil fuels are hydrocarbons, and the combustion of hydrocarbons [[hydro]]
