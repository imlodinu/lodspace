# objectives
- [x] I can review what is meant by a fossil fuel (coal, crude oil, natural gas).  [completion:: 2023-07-20]
	- [[#fossil fuels]]
- [x] I can explain what happens to the levels of CO2 in the atmosphere with the burning of fossil fuels.  [completion:: 2023-07-20]
	- [[#^c46ef0]]
- [ ] I can describe the greenhouse effect using ideas about energy and radiation:
    - Earthâ€™s surface absorbs visible light from sun, temp increases, emits infrared radiation.
    - Greenhouse gases (including CO2) absorb infrared and gain vibrational energy which increases kinetic energy therefore temp of atmosphere.
- [ ] I can name common greenhouse gases (CO2, CH4, N2O, CFCs & HFCs)
- [ ] I can describe some effects of the greenhouse effect (local & global).
# fossil fuels
- a fossil fuel is a substance formed through <mark style="background: #ABF7F7A6;">high temperatures</mark> and <mark style="background: #ABF7F7A6;">high pressure</mark> from <mark style="background: #ABF7F7A6;">decaying</mark> plant and animal matter over prolonged periods of time.
- a fossil fuel ultimately is a hydrocarbon mixture.
- with the burning of fossil fuels, the levels of $CO_2$ in the atmosphere increases. ^c46ef0
	- fossil fuels are hydrocarbons, and the combustion of hydrocarbons results in the release of $CO_2$ and $H_2O$.
# greenhouse effect
- when insolation reaches earth's surface, some is reflected in the form of albedo. 
- the albedo reflects onto greenhouse gases, such as $CO_2$, increasing their kinetic energy (heat).
- with an increase of greenhouse gases, less of the albedo is reflected into space and more
