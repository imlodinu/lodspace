I'm in the bus rn.
I don't wanna get into another relationship. I'm afraid of being hurt and hurting the ones I care about again. I don't know if I'll be able to be close to another person and feel as comfortable as I was a few months ago. Maybe I'll die alone. I don't know.
I wanna open up to someone but I'm so scared they're gonna stab me in the back like niki did.
