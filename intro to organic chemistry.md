# organic chemistry

- Organic chemistry is centered on carbon, hydrogen, and organic compounds.
- Organic compounds:
    - form covalent bonds
    - have low melting and boiling points
    - are flammable
    - are soluble in nonpolar solvents, but not water

# carbon

- Carbon is one of the key elements involved in organic chemistry.
- It forms a tetrahedral shape when it bonds, as it has four valence electrons.

# formulae

- There are a few ways to represent organic compounds:
    - molecular formulae: displays the quantity and composition of the compound.
    - empirical formulae: displays a ratio of the compound’s atoms:
        - i.e. $C_2 H_6 \space \space CH_3$
- Neither of these gives information about the structure of the molecule.
- structural formulae
    - lines (single, double, triple) between elements drawn in structure.
- condensed formulae
    - written in one line, it condenses the structural formula into its functional groups, omitting the single bonds.
- skeletal formulae
    - shows the bonds between carbon atoms but omits the carbon atoms. it also omits hydrogen atoms but shows other atoms.

## functional group

- An atom or group of atoms responsible for typical chemical reactions of a molecule.
    - like $O-H$

## homologous series

- A group of molecules with the same functional group but a different number of $-CH_2$ groups (methylene)
    - like a hydrocarbon (methane(0), ethane(1), propane(2), etc.)
    - expressed with an R
- Functional groups in the homologous series determine reactivity
- The length of the methylene group determines physical properties (boiling point, melting point, etc.)
- Examples:
    - alkane
    - alkene
    - alcohols
    - carboxylic acids

### general formula

- Using the general formula of a homologous series, it is possible to get the molecular formula for a certain number of carbon atoms:
    - propane:
        - Pro - 3
        - 3 carbon atoms
        - general formula for an alkane: $C_nH_{2n+2}$
        - substitute in: $C_3H_8$
        - condensed formula: $CH_3CH_2CH_3$ ($H_3CCH_2CH_3$)

# prefixes

1. meth
2. eth
3. prop
4. but
5. pent
6. hex
7. hept
8. oct
9. non

# saturated vs. unsaturated

- Saturated
    - only single C-C bonds
    - less reactive
- Unsaturated
    - C=C bonds or even C≡C bonds
    - more reactive

# homologous series

## alkanes

- General formula: $C_nH_{2n+2}$
- Names end with _***-ane***_.
- C-C bonds → saturated.
- $H_3CCH_2CH_2CH_3$
    - 3 hydrogens on the end
- Alkanes longer than four carbon atoms have structural isomerism

## alkenes

- General formula: $C_nH_{2n}$
- Names end with _***-ene***_.
- Has C=C bond → unsaturated.
- $H_2C=CHCH_2CH_3$
    - 2 hydrogens on the end
- Alkenes longer than or equal to 4 carbon atoms has positional isomerism

## alkynes

- General formula: $C_nH_{2n-2}$
- Names end with _***-yne***_.
- relatively acidic.
- $HC\equiv CCH_2CH_3$
    - 1 hydrogen on the ends.

## cycloalkanes

- General formula: $C_nH_{2n}$
- Names start with _***Cyclo-***_ and end with _***-ane***_.
- Like an alkane, it is saturated.
- It does not have the hydrogens on the very ends because it is cyclic.
- Most useful ones in organic chemistry are cyclopentane and cyclohexane

## cycloalkenes

- General formula: $C_nH_{2n-2}$
- Names start with _***Cyclo-***_ and end with _***-ene***_.
- IUPAC naming starts at the double carbon bond and goes through it to keep index numbers low.
- Like an alkene, it is saturated.

# isomers

- Molecules with the same molecular formular but way the atoms are arranged are different.
- if prefixed with iso, then structure is unknown (isopentane is same as 2-methylbutane and 3-methylbutane)
- Structural isomerism
    - same molecular formular, different structure
    - subsets
        - positional isomerism
            - functional group is attached to a different carbon atom
            - same molecular formular, different position of the bonds. (but-1-ene, but-2-ene)
        - chain isomerism
            - carbon chain arranged differently
            - for example: alkenes
            - hexane ↔ 3-methylpentane ↔ 2,4 dimethylbutane ↔ 2-ethylbutane
        - functional group isomerism
            - different functional groups
            - for example: sugars and alcohol are same general formula
            - when the oxygen it can go from an alcohol to an ether
- Stereoisomerism
    - same structure, but 3d arrangement is different
    - subsets
        - cis-trans isomerism
            - molecules can rotate freely around C-C bonds but not C=C bonds.
            - leads to cis-trans isomerism.
            - isomers differ in the arrangement of the groups attached to the carbons in the double bonds.
            - cis - same, trans - opposite
                - as they can’t rotate freely, then if they have different sides they are cis-trans isomers
            - has limitations for more complex organic compounds when hydrogens have been substituted
                - for example:
                    - $CIBr=CFH$ or $CIBr=CHF$
                    - it is impossible to tell if this is cis or trans
            - we use **E-Z** notation for these
        - optical isomerism
