- [ ] I can review what is meant by a fossil fuel (coal, crude oil, natural gas).
- [ ] I can explain what happens to the levels of CO2 in the atmosphere with the burning of fossil fuels.
- [ ] I can describe the greenhouse effect using ideas about energy and radiation:
    - Earthâ€™s surface absorbs visible light from sun, temp increases, emits infrared radiation.
    - Greenhouse gases (including CO2) absorb infrared and gain vibrational energy which increases kinetic energy therefore temp of atmosphere.
- [ ] I can name common greenhouse gases (CO2, CH4, N2O, CFCs & HFCs)
1- [ ] I can describe some effects of the greenhouse effect (local & global).
