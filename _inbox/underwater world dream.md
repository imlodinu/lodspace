i had a dream that the Earth flooded. it's a bit vague now that i've woken up, but i do remember some details.

1. we boarded a vessel that took us underwater. 
2. from the vess we watched the planet sink bar a small continent.
3. my view alternated between a group of people on the continent harvesting resources, and my own view.
4. depiction of what was gonna happen, a sphere improperly translated, its a few circles with nodes.
