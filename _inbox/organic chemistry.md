## functional groups and homologous series
- functional group
	- a functional group is one or more <mark style="background: #ABF7F7A6;">atoms</mark> that influences the typical chemical reactions of a molecule.
- homologous series
	- a homologous series is a <mark style="background: #ABF7F7A6;">group of molecules</mark>, only differing by the number of CH2.
	- it can be akin to a family, where each member has a different number of methyl.
	- for example, methane, ethane, and propane would all be in the same homologous series.
		- methane has one methyl, ethane has two, and propane has three.
		- the alkanes, which is the name of this homologous series, have single bonds between carbon and hydrogen.
- these two elements of a molecule determine different things:
	- functional group determines
		- chemical properties, such as reactivity.
	- the length of the carbon chain(s) in a homologous series determines
		- physical properties, such as boiling and melting points.
## carbon
- carbon can bond in
	- 4 single; 1 double and 2 single; 2 double; 1 triple and 1 single bond.
	- this is because it has 4 valence electrons.
	- it can only form the equivalent of 4 single bonds by sahring its 4 valence electrons.
## saturated vs unsaturated hydrocarbons
- saturated hydrocarbons
	- only have single bonds. unreactive.
	- therefore they are saturated, as they have the most amount of hydrogen they can bond with.
	- since they have a lot of hydrogen bonded, they are <mark style="background: #ABF7F7A6;">unreactive</mark> with the exception of combustion.
- unsaturated hydrocarbons
	- double and triple bonds present. reactive.
	- they are unsaturated because, unlike the saturated hydrocarbons, they don't have as many hydrogens bonded to them as possible.
	- this causes them to be <mark style="background: #ABF7F7A6;">reactive</mark>.
## isomerism
* an isomer is
	* an organic molecule with the same molecular formula but with a different structure.
	* for example, pentane is different to 2,2-dimethylpropane but both have the same number of carbon and hydrogen atoms.
* a structural isomer has differing
	* names, 
	* chemical properties,
	* and shapes
## physical properties
- melting point
	- the temperature at which a substance changes states of matter from solid to liquid.
- boiling point
	- the temperature at which a substance changes states of matter from liquid to gas.
- the physical properties of hydrocarbons changes when the chain of CH2 gets longer due to <mark style="background: #ABF7F7A6;">van der waals</mark> forces.
	- these forces occur as at any given moment in time, more electrons would be gathered on one hemisphere of an atom or molecule.
	- this creates a positive and negative charge, which then causes more attraction on neighbouring atoms and molecules.
	- the more atoms and molecules there are, the more force there is.
	- this results in longer chains having more energy, thus needing more energy to break apart (higher boiling point).
- branched hydrocarbons have lower boiling points due to the branches distancing the molecules from each other, resulting in less van der waals forces.
- viscocity
	- viscosity refers to the thickness of a fluid, aka. how resistant it is to movements.
- longer chained hydrocarbons tend to have more viscosity, due to larger intermolecular forces acting upon the atoms and molecules.
## homologous series list
### alkanes
- alkanes are a family of hydrocarbons.
- they only contain single bonds and therefore are saturated.
- they can be arranged in continuous straight chains with branches, or in cyclical forms called cycloalkanes.
- general formula: $C_nH_{2n+2}$
- there are <mark style="background: #ABF7F7A6;">low</mark> melting and boiling points due to weak intermolecular forces; an alkane is single covalent bonded.
- 
- to sum up, alkanes are
	- <mark style="background: #ABF7F7A6;">saturated</mark> hydrocarbons with <mark style="background: #ABF7F7A6;">single bonds</mark> in <mark style="background: #ABF7F7A6;">continuous straight chains</mark> with branches or cyclical forms called cycloalkanes. 
### alkenes
## formulae
- structural formulae
	- in a structural formula, draw all of the carbons, hydrogens and other atoms.
- condensed structural formulae
	- in a condensed structural formula, omit the single bonds.
	- if there are atoms perpendicular to the parent chain, then inline them.
		- butane ($C_3H_8$) becomes $H_3CCH_2CH_3$
	- if there are functional groups perpendicular to the parent chain, then put them in brackets and inline.
		- 2-methylpentane becomes $CH_3CH(CH_3)CH_2CH_2CH_3$

### prefixes

| number of carbon | prefix |
| --- | --- |
| 1 | meth- |
| 2 | eth- |
| 3 | prop- |
| 4 | but- |
| 5 | pent- |
| 6 | hex- |
| 7 | hept- |
| 8 | oct- |


### naming branched alkanes
- example:
	- ![[labelling_branched_alkanes_0.svg|500]]
1. find the <mark style="background: #ABF7F7A6;">parent</mark> chain (the longest continuous chain of carbon atoms)
	- ![[labelling_branched_alkanes_1.svg|500]]
2. number the carbon atoms in the chain, starting from the end that will result in the smallest numbers
	- ![[labelling_branched_alkanes_2.svg|500]]
3. find the substituents (alkyls)
	- ![[labelling_branched_alkanes_3.svg|500]]
4. if there is more than one of the same substituent, use prefixes for them, such as if there were 3 methyl on carbons 2, 3, and 4, we would use `2,3,4-trimethyl`. this doesn't apply here.
5. the substituents are listed in alphabetical order (without respect to the prefixes from step 4 if they are there). in our case, we have 2-methyl and 3-ethyl, so we would write `3-ethyl-2-methyl`
6. if there are multiple numbers, such as if it was multiple methyls, we separate them with a <mark style="background: #ABF7F7A6;">comma</mark>. the subsituents are separated with <mark style="background: #ABF7F7A6;">hyphens</mark>, between the numbers, the name, and following substituents. the name of the parent chain comes last. for our example molecule, the name would be `3-ethyl-2-methylpentane`.
### naming cycloalkanes
1. count the number of carbon atoms in the ring.
2. use the prefix number.
	1. 6 carbon atoms in a ring are named cyclohexane.
3. *we do not need to be able to name branched cycloalkanes but it may be useful.*
