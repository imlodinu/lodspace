## functional groups and homologous series
- functional group
	- a functional group is one or more <mark style="background: #ABF7F7A6;">atoms</mark> that influences the typical chemical reactions of a molecule.
- homologous series
	- a homologous series is a <mark style="background: #ABF7F7A6;">group of molecules</mark>, only differing by the number of CH2.
	- it can be akin to a family, where each member has a different number of methyl.
	- for example, methane, ethane, and propane would all be in the same homologous series.
		- methane has one methyl, ethane has two, and propane has three.
		- the alkanes, which is the name of this homologous series, have single bonds between carbon and hydrogen.
- these two elements of a molecule determine different things:
	- functional group determines
		- chemical properties, such as reactivity.
	- the length of the carbon chain(s) in a homologous series determines
		- physical properties, such as boiling and melting points.
## carbon
- carbon can bond in
	- 4 single; 1 double and 2 single; 2 double; 1 triple and 1 single bond.
	- this is because it has 4 valence electrons.
	- it can only form the equivalent of 4 single bonds by sahring its 4 valence electrons.
## saturated vs unsaturated hydrocarbons
- saturated hydrocarbons
	- only have single bonds. unreactive.
	- therefore they are saturated, as they have the most amount of hydrogen they can bond with.
	- since they have a lot of hydrogen bonded, they are <mark style="background: #ABF7F7A6;">unreactive</mark> with the exception of combustion.
- unsaturated hydrocarbons
	- double and triple bonds present. reactive.
	- they are unsaturated because, unlike the saturated hydrocarbons, they don't have as many hydrogens bonded to them as possible.
	- this causes them to be <mark style="background: #ABF7F7A6;">reactive</mark>.
## isomerism
- an isomer is
	- an organic molecule with the same molecular formula but with a different structure.
	- for example, pentane is different to 2,2-dimethylpropane but both have the same number of carbon and hydrogen atoms.
### structural isomer
- a structural isomer has differing
	- names, 
	- chemical properties,
	- and shapes
### cis-trans isomerism
- occurs when there is a double bond.
	- a double bond doesn't allow for the molecules either side of it to rotate along it, therefore two isomers can have the exact same molecular formula, but different geometrical arrangement.
	- if the molecules are oriented in the same direction, then it is cis, otherwise it is trans.
- for example, $H_3CCH_2CH=CHCH_3$ is different to $H_3CCH_2CH=HCCH_3$.
	- the first has the $CH$ group oriented the same way: cis-pent-2-ene.
	- the second has the right side group oriented down: trans-pent-2-ene.
## physical properties
- melting point
	- the temperature at which a substance changes states of matter from solid to liquid.
- boiling point
	- the temperature at which a substance changes states of matter from liquid to gas.
	- the physical properties of hydrocarbons changes when the chain of CH2 gets longer due to <mark style="background: #ABF7F7A6;">van der waals</mark> forces.
		- these forces occur as at any given moment in time, more electrons would be gathered on one hemisphere of an atom or molecule.
		- this creates a positive and negative charge, which then causes more attraction on neighbouring atoms and molecules.
		- the more atoms and molecules there are, the more force there is.
		- this results in longer chains having more energy, thus needing more energy to break apart (higher boiling point).
		- branched hydrocarbons have lower boiling points due to the branches distancing the molecules from each other, resulting in less van der waals forces.
- viscocity
	- viscosity refers to the thickness of a fluid, aka. how resistant it is to movements.
	- longer chained hydrocarbons tend to have more viscosity, due to larger intermolecular forces acting upon the atoms and molecules.
- volatility
	- volatity is the how actively a substance will transition from liquid to gas.
	- alkanes with a high volatility have low boiling points
	- this is because volatility is sort of the inverse to boiling point.
		- whereas boiling point increases with the length of the carbon chain, due to the increased van der waals forces;
		- volatility decreases as it becomes harder to decompose/break the intermolecular forces.
## chemical properties
- flammability
	- flammability facilitates [[#combustion]]
## combustion
- complete combustion is when there is an excess of oxygen, resulting in $CO_2$ and $H_2O$.
- incomplete combustion is when there is a deficiency of oxygen resulting in the produces above, but also toxic byproduces such as $CO$ and $C$.
- to balance a combustion reaction:
	1. balance the <mark style="background: #BBFABBA6;">carbon</mark>.
	2. balance the <mark style="background: #BBFABBA6;">hydrogen</mark>.
	3. balance the <mark style="background: #BBFABBA6;">oxygen</mark> (if it's an odd number then multiply the entire system by 2).
## homologous series list
### alkanes
- alkanes are a family of hydrocarbons.
- minus 1 hydrogen forms: alkyl, cycloalkyl.
- they only contain single bonds and therefore are saturated.
- they can be arranged in continuous straight chains with branches, or in cyclical forms called cycloalkanes.
- general formula: $C_nH_{2n+2}$
- there are <mark style="background: #ABF7F7A6;">low</mark> melting and boiling points due to weak intermolecular forces; an alkane is single covalent bonded.
- unreactive with the exception of combustion
- to sum up, alkanes are
	- <mark style="background: #ABF7F7A6;">saturated</mark> hydrocarbons with <mark style="background: #ABF7F7A6;">single bonds</mark> in <mark style="background: #ABF7F7A6;">continuous straight chains</mark> with branches or cyclical forms called cycloalkanes.
	- a homologous series hydrocarbon that is generally unreactive and has low melting and boiling points.
### alkenes
- alkenes are a family of hydrocarbons.
- minus 1 hydrogen forms: alkenyl, cycloalkenyl.
- they have a singular $C=C$ bond, thus are unsaturated.
- this <mark style="background: #ABF7F7A6;">double bond is the functional group</mark> of alkenes.
- like alkanes, they can be arranged in continuous chains with branches or cylically in a cycloalkene.
- general formula: $C_nH_{2n}$
- slightly lower melting and boiling points than alkanes.
- more reactive than alkanes as there are sites where reactions can occur easily ($C=C$ bonds take less energy to break than $C-C$ bonds).
- to sum up aklenes are
	- <mark style="background: #ABF7F7A6;">unsaturated</mark> hydrocarbons with a <mark style="background: #ABF7F7A6;">double bond</mark> in a homologous series that is reactive.
### alkynes
- alkynes are a family of hydrocarbons.
- minus 1 hydrogen forms: alkynyl, cycloalkynyl.
- they have a singular $C\equiv C$ bond.
- the <mark style="background: #ABF7F7A6;">triple bond is the functional group</mark> of alkynes.
- like alkenes and alkanes, they can be put in continuous chains with branches or cyclically in a cycloalkyne.
- general formula: $C_nH_{2n-2}$
- higher melting and boiling points than alkanes and alkenes.
- to sum up, alkynes are
	- <mark style="background: #ABF7F7A6;">unsaturated</mark> hydrocarbons with a <mark style="background: #ABF7F7A6;">triple bond</mark> in a homologous series that, compared with alkenes and alkanes, have a higher boiling and melting point.
### cycloalkanes
- cycloalkanes are a family of cyclic hydrocarbons.
- they are rings of carbon atoms singly bonded.
- the smallest ring size is found with cyclopropane.
- general formula: $C_nH_{2n}$
### cycloalkenes
- cycloalkanes are a family of cyclic hydrocarbons.
- they are rings of carbon atoms singly bonded with a double bond.
- general formula: $C_nH_{2(n-m)}$, where m is the number of double bonds.
## formulae
- structural formulae
	- in a structural formula, draw all of the carbons, hydrogens and other atoms.
- condensed structural formulae
	- in a condensed structural formula, omit the single bonds.
	- if there are atoms perpendicular to the parent chain, then inline them.
		- butane ($C_3H_8$) becomes $H_3CCH_2CH_3$
	- if there are functional groups perpendicular to the parent chain, then put them in brackets and inline.
		- 2-methylpentane becomes $CH_3CH(CH_3)CH_2CH_2CH_3$
## IUPAC naming system
- [alkane naming practice](http://chemware.co.nz/orgquiz.htm)
### prefixes

| number of carbon | prefix |
| --- | --- |
| 1 | meth- |
| 2 | eth- |
| 3 | prop- |
| 4 | but- |
| 5 | pent- |
| 6 | hex- |
| 7 | hept- |
| 8 | oct- |


### naming branched alkanes
- example:
	- ![[labelling_branched_alkanes_0.svg|500]]
1. find the <mark style="background: #ABF7F7A6;">parent</mark> chain (the longest continuous chain of carbon atoms)
	- ![[labelling_branched_alkanes_1.svg|500]]
2. number the carbon atoms in the chain, starting from the end that will result in the smallest numbers
	- ![[labelling_branched_alkanes_2.svg|500]]
3. find the substituents (alkyls)
	- ![[labelling_branched_alkanes_3.svg|500]]
4. if there is more than one of the same substituent, use prefixes for them, such as if there were 3 methyl on carbons 2, 3, and 4, we would use `2,3,4-trimethyl`. this doesn't apply here.
5. the substituents are listed in alphabetical order (without respect to the prefixes from step 4 if they are there). in our case, we have 2-methyl and 3-ethyl, so we would write `3-ethyl-2-methyl`
6. if there are multiple numbers, such as if it was multiple methyls, we separate them with a <mark style="background: #ABF7F7A6;">comma</mark>. the subsituents are separated with <mark style="background: #ABF7F7A6;">hyphens</mark>, between the numbers, the name, and following substituents. the name of the parent chain comes last. for our example molecule, the name would be `3-ethyl-2-methylpentane`.
### naming cycloalkanes
1. count the number of carbon atoms in the ring.
2. use the prefix number.
	1. 6 carbon atoms in a ring are named cyclohexane.
3. *we do not need to be able to name branched cycloalkanes but it may be useful.*
### naming cycloalkenes
1. same process as [[#naming cycloalkanes]], but with a differing suffix.
### naming straight chain alkenes
1. similar processs to naming alkanes, but when the parent chain is longer than 3 carbon atoms, a carbon atom number is needed to indicate the position of the carbon double bond.
	1. this results in a [[#structural isomer]]
2. sometimes the position of the $C=C$ bond would be placed at the start of the name, but in accordance with IUPAC, the name should be placed between the prefix and the *-ene*.
	1. for example, $CH_3CH=CHCH_3$ (butene with the double bond on the 2nd carbon atom) would be written as <mark style="background: #ABF7F7A6;">but-2-ene</mark>, not <mark style="background: #FF5582A6;">2-butene</mark>, for the sake of clarity.
3. as with alkanes, the naming should start from the end of the chain resulting in the lowest carbon atom indices.
	1. for example, $CH_3CH=CHCH_2CH_3$ (propene) would be written as <mark style="background: #ABF7F7A6;">prop-2-ene</mark>, not <mark style="background: #FF5582A6;">prop-3-ene</mark>, as we count the carbon atoms from the left.
### naming branched alkenes
1. follow [[#naming straight chain alkenes]]
2. for any substituents, follow the [[#naming branched alkanes]] from step 3.
	1. the naming for these is the same bar the parent chain being an alkene.
### naming straight chain alkynes
1. the exact same process as alkenes with the only different being the parent chain suffix being *-yne*, and looking for a triple bond instead of a double bond.
