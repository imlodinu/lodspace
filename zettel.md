# workflow
1. make fleeting notes
	1. always capture ideas that pop into mind
	2. reminders of what's in my head
	3. write them however i want and put them in [[ztinbox]]
2. make literature notes (<mark style="background: #ADCCFFA6;">zotero</mark>)
	1. when i read something, i will reinterpret the content and write it in my own words as closely as I can to the source content
	2. write things that are important or i might use later, that i wouldn't want to go back into the book and trawl for
	3. **keep it short**
	4. copy a few quotes that i really understand
3. make permanent notes
	1. go through the inbox and review the notes in the inbox (once a day at a minimum)
	2. think about how they relate to my own ideas, writing and research
	3. compare the note with other notes in the slip box. how does it relate? differ? what new ideas or relationships are there? questions?
4. link permanent notes to the slip box using structure notes
	1. add backlinks to other notes, if it doesn't have any just leave it be
5. develop project notes
	1. ground up from the information in the zettel
	2. don't cling to ideas
	3. find chains of notes in the zettel and use them to add ideas
6. translate the project notes into a manuscript
	1. translating is important because it brings into context the idea
