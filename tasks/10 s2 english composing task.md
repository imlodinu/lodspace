# statement of intent
I have chosen to respond to the second prompt, with my studied texts being _2BR02B_ and _A Sound of Thunder_. My exposition uses the generic dystopian style from both texts to present my rendition of a dystopian world. I took a lot of stylistic inspiration from _A Sound of Thunder_, with its vibrant and flowery language being present throughout my exposition; however, I chose to omit using dialogue until the very end, which I use to craft my own style. Whilst the short story leans towards more of a science fiction genre, it presents dystopian conventions, such as the oppression of individuality and intellect under a dictator. I have used differing dystopian conventions, notably corporate control (not directly mentioned in the exposition but alluded to), a dystopian protagonist questioning and struggling against society, and rebellion against society (also alluded to). _2BR02B_ had more of a dystopian influence on my exposition. Elements of my world, notably society, are inspired by _2BR02B_; my society is on the verge of becoming akin to the story’s society – the population would explode, and laws would be made. I also took a lot of inspiration from other texts, including those in other mediums; the character the protagonist is introduced to at the end is inspired by Splinter from _Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles_, and my protagonist is inspired by David Martinez from _Cyberpunk Edgerunners_. The setting is based on an idea I had for NAPLAN writing in year 9, but written in more vivid language.
